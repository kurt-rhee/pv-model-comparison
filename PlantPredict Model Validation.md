- Description:
	- The following table is a collection of 3rd party studies which quantify the accuracy of PlantPredict's entire performance model chain, as opposed to the individual models within the chain.
- Metrics:
	- MBD:  Mean Bias Difference
	- MxD:  Maximum Difference
	- STD:  1 Sigma standard deviation
